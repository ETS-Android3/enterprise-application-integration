Install the mongo docker image: (https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo)
docker pull mongo

start the mongo server instance:
docker run --name some-mongo -d mongo:tag
e.g.
docker run --name mongo -d mongo:latest -p 27017:27017
DO NOT FORGET TO EXPOSE THE PORT as is done with the -p option

install the mongo shell to be able to access the database:
You do not have to download the server. Just download the client.
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/
https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server
You can run this client with ./mongo

after this you have a mongo database up and running and you can connect with it via the shell.
